# Deep learning with pytorch
this will be a series of different deep learning projects, using the popular framework [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). 

It'll cover various topics and explore different models and ideas, going from vanilla neural networks, RNNs, CNNs to some of the SOAT techniques like BERT model and much more.

We'll be working on Jupyter notebooks. Each project will consist of a notebook, in which we'll attempt to solve a specific problematic using a deep learning technique. The same **pipeline of work** will be followed:
1. Describe the task and the overall objective
2. Prepare the Data
3. Build the model
4. Train the model and evaluate it
5. Do some fun experiments

## Summary of projects:
- Build your first neural network for digit recognition and learn about hyperparameter tuning
- Get your hands on recurrent neural networks to perform POS tagging
- Generating music using LSTM cells
- Computer vision with CNNs and how transfer learning can be performed
- Can machines imitate art?
- Attention models for translation
- Generating new faces using GANs
- YOLO for object detection
- Transformers, BERT and the new breakthrough in the nlp world
> Note that this is a temporary list of the projects and is still on progress. It's a road map for the projects that I aim to build.


Finally, I want to say that this will be most of all a personal exploration in the world of deep learning and a learning experience. It's not intended to be a guide to be followed as I'm not much experienced, plus I myself have to resort to different resources and others pieces of work first. In fact my work will consist mostly of a reproduction with some personal tweaks, at each sub-project I'll make sure to mention the different resources I used.
